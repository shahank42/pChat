# What is this?

pChat provides a very privacy-centric messaging experience. Everything is stored in a decentralised database, no servers involved!
Everyone using the app stores some part of the database with them, forming a peer-to-peer network. This is made possible with the help of GUN.js.

Try it out live at: https://pchat-chi.vercel.app

# Feedback

I really enjoyed making this app, and would love to hear feedback, criticism and different ways to enhance pChat.

In fact, why not give do so through the [dedicated pChat room](https://pchat-chi.vercel.app/chat/8234g3ee713j1b1jaj9)  `^_^`

Alternatively, contact can be made through e-mail (shounakghosh42@gmail.com) and Discord (https://discordapp.com/users/709289605580587008).

The features available in the app were guided by a strong set of core beliefs which I thought every messaging app should follow, so it is pretty opinionated in that regard. However I still think there is much, much more room for improvement, and therefore I'm always open to suggestions.
